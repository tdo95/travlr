## How it's made  🏗
**Tech Used:**

## Lessons Learned 🎖
- Express's static module will handle requests if it finds a matching route. This means any requests handlers that may be defined after static is used will not run.
- There is a performance distinction between innerText and textContent in some browsers. This is because innerText requires layout context in order to render, so it could take longer to produce
- It's important to trim values entered by a user before logging it in a database as the value returned from the database may not include the whitespace
