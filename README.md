## How it's made  🏗
**Tech Used:** HTML, EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Pixabay API, RoadGoat API

## Features 📱
- 

## Lessons Learned 🎖
- Express's static module will handle requests if it finds a matching route. This means any requests handlers that may be defined after static is used will not run.
- There is a performance distinction between innerText and textContent in some browsers. This is because innerText requires layout context in order to render, so it could take longer to produce
- It's important to trim values entered by a user before logging it in a database as the value returned from the database may not include the whitespace

## Future Improvements 📊
- Optimize ellipis button to block all interaction until closed
- Expand explore section support location lookup and browsing
